<img src="../public/img/fiona-small.jpg"/>My name is Fiona and I like to make pretty things. I'm a University of Waterloo student by day and a design nerd by night.  

I started Designs by Fiona on Instagram as a way to track my progress as I taught myself calligraphy. Four months later, here we are connecting on my very own website! First and foremost- welcome! I have an overwhelming feeling of joy and excitement that you've taken time out of your day to stop by. Designs by Fiona is a platform I am extremely excited to call my own. It's a platform that stands for creativity and empowerment. It's a place for me to share my work, thoughts, and ideas with you and I'm interested to hear what you have to say as well. So, drop me a note and let's chat!  I'm a huge believer in building people up and through Designs by Fiona, I hope to share my sense of purpose with you. Hopefully one day it turns into a business, for now it's my journey. Will you join me?
